  <p><em>The server for an Automated Medicine Dispenser – Part of a Senior Design Project</em></p>
  <p>The goal of the Automated Medicine Dispenser is to make the process of taking medication simpler for the user, specifically senior citizens. As a senior citizen, memory and physical capabilities start to decline. These declines cause difficulties in taking the required medication for the user. When the mind starts to deteriorate, a senior citizen could forget to take their medication or overdose after taking more medication than required. Both cases would cause dire circumstances for that senior citizen. Another issue is that depending on someone else for such a crucial component of one’s life is not wanted, but is sometimes necessary. With the decline of physical capabilities in a person, they’re forced to rely upon a caretaker to assist them. It isn’t fair to take that responsibility away from the senior citizen and give it to that caretaker.  With this device, most of the problems associated with the mental limitations will be eliminated and the responsibility of one’s own life will be given back to them.</p>
  <p>The Automated Medicine Dispenser will be a device that eliminates problems associated with the mental and physical limitations through its helpful features. With the application allowing the user to program the schedule the device follows, the amount of medication dispensed and the amount of medication remaining, along with the device notifying them and disposing missed dosages, the concerns and hazards caused by memory loss and decline in physical capability are greatly reduced. This device gives a person’s life back to them by eliminating the need for a constant caretaker. It allows them to take their mind off the stress caused by health concerns. The Automated Medicine Dispenser is the solution to a user’s medication routine.</p>
